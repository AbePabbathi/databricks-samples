# databricks-samples

This is a repository of sample code useful for building your data platform on Databricks. Most of this code is tested on specific versions of Databricks Runtime and hence may not work as intended in your environment. Please use caution while running this code without understanding what is going on in the code. That said, my hope is this code will help you speed up your implemenation by days, weeks and even months by leveraging these code samples. Please feel free to provide your feedback on how I can improve these via email at abraham.pabbathi@databricks.com. Thanks! and happy coding!
